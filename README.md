# Chatlog_Rippa
In WDI, we share everything. Plenty of awesome resouces will inevitably be forgotten.

This very simple program to help WDI'ers rip URL's out of Slack (Melb WDI2 had 15k+ of messages).


Please note this will return **AL**L urls. If you dont want .jpg, .png, .gif etc, just set up an if condition in the logs.each_line block.
