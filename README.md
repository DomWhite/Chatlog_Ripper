# Chatlog Ripper
In WDI, we share everything. Plenty of awesome resouces will inevitably be forgotten.

This very simple program to help anyone rip URL's out of Slack, IRC, etc (Melb WDI2 Slack channel had more than 15 thousand lines of messages (ugh..)).

Please note this will return **ALL** urls. If you dont want .jpg, .png, .gif etc, just set up an if condition in the logs.each_line block.
